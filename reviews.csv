I had never even heard of this store before I had a fraudulent transaction appear from my bank card. I attempted to get my money refunded via Chat, but the customer service person just kept saying that they couldn't find out who used my card details and to contact the police. The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

I attempted to get my money refunded via Chat, but the customer service person just kept saying that they couldn't find out who used my card details and to contact the police. The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

The store is in Casablanca, I am in Australia. I work for an online store here, and our company would at least look into the transaction, and when found would be able to tell it wasn't me. This company is just a front for criminal activity.

An order from Jumia has less chance than going to the casino one evening to win money. In 50% of the cases, the order is canceled, of the 50% that remains, 50% is not delivered. It is always the customer's fault, they never do anything wrong. As a customer I have two things to do: select an item and pay for it. Jumia is tasked with delivering the product but unfortunately that is too much to ask

Horrible company / very unprofessional and manipulative. They cancelled my order couple of times in order to increase the price. When I called they totally ignored my complains. Highly UNrecommended

Jumia Ghana is a no no no for me. Their utmost disrespect of clients with their take it or leave it refund policy doesn’t work for me. Customer care is poor. And the difficulty to speak to someone besides the customer care agent is insane. All testimonials on their website are positive and that alone rise question marks.  Check third-party websites like Trustpilot, Ghanayello and you will encounter the real Jumia. Don't waste your precious time and money on this company. Look elsewhere you will be greatly valued. Choose Jumia to shop and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. I will definitely rate Jumia negative star if there was one.

What you see on the photo is not what you get. The description of any of their products is purely copy & paste of an original branded product, which obviously is copied from another website. When you place your order, you get a fake chinese product instead. Buyer beware, those photos you see are meant to make you think you are purchasing a genuine product, but alas…..

Very! Very! Lousy customer care service! I ordered two items (a belt and a shirt) from Jumia and paid for them all together as one package. Only to receive one item (the belt). I mean, the savagery!!!! If they were planning on doing me like that, why not go easy on me and deliver the shirt, hold the belt instead? It's hard to make money these days and even if you do, its not enough to fund scammers like these. Since JUMIA got listed on NYSE and started fetching investors, it became bigger than caring about who they're vendors and customers are! ITS CHAOS OUT HERE! AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BEAR FOR JUMIA STOCK!!! I hope my $9 made a difference in your profits, you bastards!!!!

Jumia Delivery and Customer Agents are both deceptive. They mark packages as delivered, when in fact they are not.

Customer Service claims they are going to looking into solving issues; however, they do not call back until weeks later.

When asking for a Supervisor it takes a week to call back.

Inorder to get packages delivered you have to pay an extra delivery costs because as Delivery Agents claim, they don't have transport money.

Horrible Customer Service and Deceptive Delivery Agents!

If you don't care about losing your hard-earned money, just buy from these losers who know nothing about customer service. I bought a Kindle device 4 months ago and it started acting up recently (Device turning pages by itself and clicking words). When I reached out to them, they said I had only 7 days to return a product. I'm never buying from you again and I'll make sure I tell every person I meet about this horrible experience.

Jumia does not have an option for customers to talk with an actual customer service representative. Everything is automated with preset questions and answers. When you have a unique issue and require to talk to a person you are on your own. The contacts on the web site gives a number where you talk to a robot who gives you 6 options for only 6 preset problems/issues :-(

***DO NOT BUT FROM JUMIA!!***

Do not any electronic from jumia. I bought a mobile phone came faulty. Tried to return it, they said they checked the phone had no issues and phone came back with issues. They never GIVE REFUNDS!

Don’t trust jumia at all they lie alot over the phone. Sent the phone to them to get a refund, they said it will take 10 days and the issue they mentioned was the issue I didn’t complain about. Wasted 2-3 working hours per day for 1 month and still didn’t get a refund. They do not CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Poor customer Service. They do not have a heart. Customer service probably knows they’re being paid with stolen money but don’t care about giving refunds.

God I cannot explain how much I hate this company. Their website is horrible, awful. For some reason I placed an order with this app, but it sent to the wrong address. I immediately noticed the mistake but could not cancel.
There is NO customer service - the help section on the website does not work, the cancel order button does not work, the live chat is just a robot, the phone is just a robot. There is no way to speak to an actual person!
Also, they do NOT accept returns/refunds.They take your money and then run. What an awful garbage company!!

Also, 10 days for delivery? Are you serious!??! The item is less than 2 miles away...

Also their food delivery app is garbage.

Jumia is very difficult to purchase from if a glitch develops. Their delivery is unreliable and they don’t make an effort to resolve these issue like Amazon.
